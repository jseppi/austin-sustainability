# Austin STAR Community <br/> Application & Site Guide

## Managing Content

### Introduction

There are eight special files from which the Austin STAR Community application gets its content. These files are located in the `_public/content/` folder.

![Content Files Directory](img/content_files.png)

The eight files are

* `home.yml` - Content for the Home page
* `arts_education_and_culture.yml` - Content for the Arts, Education, and Culture section
* `built_environment.yml` - Content for the Built Environment section
* `climate_and_energy.yml` - Content for the Climate and Energy section
* `economy_and_jobs.yml` - Content for the Economy and Jobs section
* `equity_and_empowerment.yml` - Content for the Equity and Empowerment section
* `health_and_safety.yml` - Content for the Health and Safety section
* `natural_systems.yml` - Content for the Natural Systems section

The content files use a text-based file format called "YAML". You can edit the content files in any text-editor, though an advanced editor such as Notepad++ (freely available at [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)), is suggested because they typically provide convenient syntax highlighting.

### YAML Basics

Documentation for YAML can be found at [http://www.yaml.org/](http://www.yaml.org/) though a deep understanding is not required for modifying the application's content.

For the YAML content files for this application there are only two basic terms to understand: *properties* and *lists*.

#### Properties

A *property* is indicated by its name, followed by a colon (`:`), and then its value. 

Example: `title: Climate and Energy`

In this example, "title" is the name of the property, and "Climate and Energy" is the value.

#### Lists

A *list* is a special value that contains multiple items, which can each have multiple properties. A *list* is indicated by a dash (`-`) symbol.

Example:

```
slides:
  - image: content/images/placeholder200x100.gif
    content: |
      Austin has a long history and strong track record for environmental stewardship and sustainability leadership. But how can we really know how sustainable our community is?
  - image: content/images/placeholder200x100.gif
    content: |
      The STAR Community Rating System is the nationâ€™s first voluntary, self-reporting framework for evaluating, quantifying, and improving the livability and sustainability of U.S. communities.
```

In this example, the "slides" property has a list as its value. Each item in the list has a property named "image" and a property named "content".

### Markdown

Some of the property values in the YAML content files of this application are in a special language called *Markdown*. Full documentation for Markdown can be found at [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

In the STAR Community application's YAML files, Markdown syntax is used anywhere you see a property name followed by a vertical pipe `|` symbol.

Example:

```
content: |
  Austin had to document progress in 10 areas related to waste minimization. One of these areas is related to Austin's goal for Zero Waste.

  #### Sustainability Benchmark

  Show progress toward achieving a 100% reduction by 2050 in total solid waste land-filled.

  #### How Austin's Doing

  Total solid waste disposed is on track to fall below 0 percent by 2050.

  Between 2009 and 2013, the City of Austin reduced the amount of solid waste disposed of in landfills by nearly 20% by promoting recycling, reduction, reuse, repair, and redesign.

  * List item 1
  * List item 2
  * List item 3

  1. Ordered list item 1 
  2. Ordered list item 2 
  3. Ordered list item 3 
```

In this example, the lines marked with `####` are headers, while all the other lines are just plain paragraph text.

The lines becoming with `*` become items in an unordered list, and the lines beginning with a number and a period become items in an ordered list.

### Home Page Content

![Home Slides](img/home_slides.png) 

The home page content file, `home.yml`, is where the content for the "slides" on the application's home page is defined.

This content is stored in a YAML list called `slides` as shown in the image below. Each item in the `slides` list has an `image` property and a `content` property.

There is also a property called `isComingSoon`. Setting `isComingSoon` to `true` will cause a large "Coming Soon" message to be displayed on the home page.

### Section Content

All of the seven content section pages follow the same general format.
