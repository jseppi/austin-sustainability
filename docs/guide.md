# Austin STAR Community <br/> Application & Site Guide

## Managing Content

### Introduction

There are eight special files from which the Austin STAR Community application gets its content. These files are located in the `_public/content/` folder.

The eight files are

* `home.yml` - Content for the Home page
* `arts_education_and_culture.yml` - Content for the Arts, Education, and Culture section
* `built_environment.yml` - Content for the Built Environment section
* `climate_and_energy.yml` - Content for the Climate and Energy section
* `economy_and_jobs.yml` - Content for the Economy and Jobs section
* `equity_and_empowerment.yml` - Content for the Equity and Empowerment section
* `health_and_safety.yml` - Content for the Health and Safety section
* `natural_systems.yml` - Content for the Natural Systems section

The content files use a text-based file format called "YAML". Details about YAML can be found at [http://www.yaml.org/](http://www.yaml.org/) though a deep understanding is not required for modifying the application's content. You can edit the content files in any text-editor, though an advanced editor such as Notepad++ (freely available at [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)), is suggested because they typically provide convenient syntax highlighting.

### Home Page Content

The home page content file, `home.yml`, is where the content for the "slides" on the application's home page is defined.
