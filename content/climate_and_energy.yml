            Austin had to document progress in 10 areas related to waste minimization. One of these areas is related to Austin's goal for Zero Waste.

            #### Sustainability Benchmark

            Show progress toward achieving a 100% reduction by 2050 in total solid waste land-filled.

            #### How Austin's Doing

            Total solid waste disposed is on track to fall below 0 percent by 2050.

            Between 2009 and 2013, the City of Austin reduced the amount of solid waste disposed of in landfills by nearly 20% by promoting recycling, reduction, reuse, repair, and redesign.
