            Austin reported on 11 areas that describe our green infrastructure systems. One of these areas concerns Austin's urban forest and our tree canopy.

            #### Sustainability Benchmark

            Demonstrate that at least 35% of land is shaded by tree canopy or dedicated to wetlands or parks.

            #### How Austin's Doing

            Percent of Land: 39.7%  
            Austin area: 171,354.4 acres  
            Tree Canopy, Wetland, and Parks: 68,026.1

            The City of Austin works hard, alongside local community partners, to ensure the City is well-distributed with land that creates a robust green infrastructure system.
