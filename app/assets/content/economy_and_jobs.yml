            Austin was asked to provide details on 12 areas related to our Quality Jobs and Living Wages. One of these areas has to do with household income.

            #### Sustainability Benchmark

            Increase real median household income over time.

            #### How Austin's Doing

            2.08% decline in real median income from baseline year.

            Although the City of Austin has been unable to show an increase in real median household income since the economic collapse in 2008, we are acknowledged for the following important actions that support economic sustainability taking place:

            * Creation of a living wage ordinance
            * City programs and partnerships in job training, job readiness, ESL, and GED prep
